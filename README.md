# ft_iterative_factorial


This repository features the implementation of `ft_iterative_factorial`, a function designed to compute the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach. This custom function is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating how to implement fundamental mathematical operations in C.

## Function Overview

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`, denoted by `n!`. The `ft_iterative_factorial` function calculates this value iteratively, providing a robust and efficient solution for factorial calculation.
